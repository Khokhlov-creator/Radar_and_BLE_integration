# Radar_and_BLE_integration

This repository is used to store all the codes for my semestral project.
It contains Python scripts to receive and visualize data fetched from BLE devices (#TODO write these devices) and radar (AWR-2944 from TI).




# Usage

If you want to use these script, you will mostly need to use "final.py", but firstly, you will need to configure radar. To do so, you will need to use "rad.py" first
